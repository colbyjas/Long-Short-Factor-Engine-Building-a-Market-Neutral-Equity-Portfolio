# BRG Project 2: Long/Short Momentum Strategy

**Author:** Colby Jaskowiak  
**Organization:** Buffalo Research Group  
**Date:** December 2025  

---

## Project Overview

This project develops and backtests a **quantitative long/short equity strategy** using 12-1 month momentum signals on the S&P 500. The strategy systematically buys (goes long) the top momentum decile and sells (goes short) the bottom momentum decile, rebalancing quarterly over an 8-year period (2017-2025).

**Key Results:**
- **1,147% cumulative return** ($1 → $12.47)
- **33.4% annualized return**
- **0.78 Sharpe ratio**
- **77% quarterly win rate**

However, factor analysis revealed a critical insight: returns were driven primarily by **leveraged market beta (2.43)** rather than pure momentum alpha, fundamentally changing how we interpret these results.

## Project Goals

1. **Build a systematic momentum strategy** with reproducible signal construction and portfolio formation
2. **Backtest performance** across multiple market regimes (bull and bear markets)
3. **Validate robustness** through rigorous out-of-sample analysis
4. **Analyze factor characteristics** (decile monotonicity, turnover, beta exposure)
5. **Identify implementation challenges** (transaction costs, market neutrality)

## Methodology

### Signal Construction

**Momentum Signal:**
```
Momentum(i,t) = [Price(i,t-1) / Price(i,t-12)] - 1
```

We calculate the **12-1 month return** (skipping the most recent month) to avoid short-term reversal effects that can obscure medium-term trends.

**Why skip the last month?**  
Academic research shows the most recent month often exhibits mean reversion, while months 2-12 capture momentum persistence.

### Portfolio Construction

**Universe:** S&P 500 stocks (401 after data quality filters)  
**Rebalancing:** Quarterly (end of March, June, September, December)  
**Formation Process:**
1. Rank all stocks by momentum signal
2. Divide into 10 deciles (~40 stocks per decile)
3. **Long:** Top decile (highest momentum)
4. **Short:** Bottom decile (lowest momentum)

**Position Sizing:**
- Equal-weight within each leg (2.5% per stock)
- 5% maximum position cap
- Dollar-neutral: $1.00 long = $1.00 short

### Data

**Source:** Yahoo Finance (via `yfinance`)  
**Period:** November 2015 - November 2025 (10 years)  
**Frequency:** Daily prices → Monthly resampling  
**Survivorship Bias:** Uses current S&P 500 constituents (acknowledged limitation)

## Key Results

### Full-Sample Performance (2017-2025)

| Metric | Long Only | Short Only | **Long-Short** |
|--------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| **Total Return** | 382% | 291% | **1,147%** |
| **Ann. Return** | 19.7% | 16.9% | **33.4%** |
| **Ann. Volatility** | 20.4% | 25.4% | **43.0%** |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | 0.97 | 0.66 | **0.78** |
| **Max Drawdown** | -19.6% | -30.5% | **-49.1%** |
| **Win Rate** | 80% | 69% | **77%** |

### Out-of-Sample Validation

To assess robustness, we split data into:
- **In-Sample (IS):** 2017-2021 (5 years)
- **Out-of-Sample (OOS):** 2022-2025 (3.5 years)

| Portfolio | IS Sharpe | OOS Sharpe | **Retention** |
|-----------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Long Only | 1.07 | 0.80 | 75% |
| Short Only | 0.71 | 0.60 | 85% |
| **Long-Short** | **0.83** | **0.71** | **86%** |

**Key Finding:** 86% Sharpe retention is exceptional for quantitative strategies (typical degradation: 30-50%). The strategy remained profitable through the 2022 bear market, providing strong evidence of robustness.

## Critical Findings

### 1. Momentum Factor Failure

**Expected:** Returns should increase from Decile 1 (worst) to Decile 10 (best)  
**Reality:** **Negative spread** - bottom decile outperformed top decile by 0.44% per quarter

This suggests **mean reversion dominated momentum** during this period, contradicting the core hypothesis.

### 2. Excessive Turnover

**Average quarterly turnover:** 94%  
**Implication:** Nearly the entire portfolio churns every quarter

At 20 bps per round-trip trade, this implies ~75 bps annual transaction cost drag—severely impacting real-world profitability.

### 3. High Market Beta

**Portfolio beta to S&P 500:** 2.43 (range: 2.02 - 2.77)

Despite dollar-neutral construction, the strategy has significant positive beta. This occurred because:
- High-momentum stocks (our longs) systematically have higher betas
- Strategy captures leveraged market exposure, not pure momentum alpha

### Return Attribution

```
Total Return (33.4% ann.) ≈ Market Beta (2.43 × ~12% SPY) + Small Alpha + Leverage
                          ≈ 29.2% (beta) + minimal alpha
```

**Conclusion:** This is fundamentally a **leveraged equity strategy**, not a market-neutral arbitrage.

## What Worked

- **Strong OOS performance** - 86% Sharpe retention validates robustness  
- **Multi-regime consistency** - Profitable in both bull and bear markets  
- **Both legs contributed** - Long and short independently profitable  
- **High win rate** - 77% quarterly success demonstrates consistency  

---

## What Didn't Work

- **Momentum factor failed** - Negative decile spread contradicts hypothesis  
- **Excessive turnover** - 94% churn creates severe transaction costs  
- **High beta exposure** - 2.43 beta eliminates market-neutral benefits  
- **Non-monotonic returns** - Factor doesn't work cleanly across distribution  

---

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Beta Neutralization
**Issue:** 2.43 beta to S&P 500  
**Solution:** Weight positions by inverse beta to target |β| < 0.3  
**Impact:** Isolate pure momentum alpha from market exposure

### 2. Turnover Reduction
**Issue:** 94% quarterly churn  
**Solutions:**
- Implement position buffers (only rebalance if stock moves 2+ deciles)
- Use quintiles instead of deciles (fewer positions)
- Target: <50% quarterly turnover

### 3. Signal Optimization
**Issue:** 12-1 month signal may be suboptimal  
**Solutions:**
- Test alternative windows: 6-2, 9-1, 3-1 months
- Combine with value/quality factors for stability
- Adaptive lookback based on volatility regime

### 4. Risk Management
**Additions:**
- Sector neutralization (prevent unintended industry bets)
- Liquidity-based position caps (ADV constraints)
- Dynamic drawdown controls

## Educational Value

This project demonstrates the **complete quantitative research workflow:**

1. **Signal Construction** - Building momentum factors from price data
2. **Portfolio Formation** - Systematic ranking and position sizing
3. **Backtesting** - Proper simulation avoiding look-ahead bias
4. **Risk Analysis** - Sharpe ratios, drawdowns, beta, turnover
5. **Out-of-Sample Validation** - Testing robustness on unseen data
6. **Performance Attribution** - Understanding true drivers of returns

**Key Lesson:** Strong absolute returns ≠ strong alpha. Decomposing performance into beta, leverage, and skill is essential.

## Disclaimer

This project is for **educational and research purposes only**. It does not constitute investment advice or a recommendation to buy or sell any securities. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The strategy exhibits high beta exposure and significant transaction costs that would materially impact real-world implementation.

**Key Risks:**
- High market beta (2.43) means strategy amplifies market movements
- 94% turnover creates substantial transaction costs
- Survivorship bias in data (uses current S&P 500 constituents)
- Momentum factor showed negative spread in test period

Always conduct your own research and consult with a qualified financial advisor before making investment decisions.
